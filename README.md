# Machine Learning Model Deployment with Flask

Welcome to the Machine Learning Model Deployment project! This project uses Flask to deploy trained machine learning models, including YOLO (You Only Look Once), MIDAS (Multiple Depth Estimation Accuracy with Single Network), SAM (Segment Anything Module), and Stable Defusion XL

## Overview

This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful platform for deploying and serving machine learning models.

## Features

- Deployed machine learning models for:
  - Object detection using YOLO.
  - Depth estimation using MIDAS.
  - Segmentation using  SAM.
  - image generator using stable defusion XL
- Web interface for interacting with the models.


## Technologies Used

- Flask: Web framework for building the API and web interface.
- YOLO (You Only Look Once): Object detection model for real-time inference.
- MIDAS (Monocular Depth Estimation): Model for estimating depth from a single image.
- SAM (Spatial Attention Module): Model for spatial attention in images.
- Stable Defusion XL
